      <h2>THREE TIME STAMP ANNOTATIONS ABOUT THE LEADING FEMALE</h2>
<p>
    1. What she said:

    (00:32:17-00:32:36) But I cannot stay, I found my calling out there, I have seen too many in need, I cannot be happy here knowing that there's people out there who have nothing.” Nakia is not a woman who follows the traditional beliefs. When T’challa asked her to stay, she refused. There are so many things in the world worth for her to do, and there are so many missions waiting for her to accomplish. She always focuses on her dream. No woman is objectified, abused, or belittled because they are female.
    
    2. What she did:
    
    (60:25:35-60:25:38)Nakia did not fear the danger of being found by the new king, and kept on going back in order to get the heart herb she needed. Because of her plan, she saved T'challa's life and the whole country. This role shows that women are so smart and they can be so independent. If the countries without them, it will be destroyed.
    
    3. Appearance:
    
    (00:39:58-00:40:44) The clothes Nakia is wearing to the ball are very appropriate. According to the Wikipedia, we can know that Nakia is already 24 years old, and this clothes are not let Nakia expose too many skins outside, and it also show Nakia is very sexy.This shows that the women’s sex appeal is obvious but secondary to their personality and skill.
</p>




<h2>THREE TIME STAMP ANNOTATIONS ABOUT THE LEADING MALE</h2>
<p>
    1. What he said:

    (00:33:08-00:33:09) T challa said “If you were not so stubborn, you would make a great queen.” to Nakia when they have some disagreement. To some degree, I personally think there are some places that T challa show traditional masculinity. He thinks Nakia is too stubborn. However, actually women are not objects, the worth of them is not just to sit on the throne and accept all opinions that men make. They have the right to express themselves and they can govern the country better.
    
    2. What he did:
    
    (00:57:38-00:57:40)T challa decided to take agent Ross back to his own country, and cure him. We can see that T challa is a man that is full of empathy. Although he had the experience that Klaue betrayed them, he still does not want to see somebody die in front of them. Empathy is not a quality that should be treated as feminine quality and then devalued that.
    
    3. Appearance:
    
    (60:25:26-60:33:39) T challa is crying in front of his ancestors, sometimes when his emotions arouse, he cannot help to shake his own body and jump up and down. We can see that he is the king of Wakanda, however, he did not express toxic masculinity that thinks men cannot have those kinds of feelings. He knows that it is important to express emotions when needed.
</p>

<h2>THREE TIME STAMP ANNOTATIONS ABOUT THE VILLAIN</h2>
<p>
    1. What he said:

    (60:27:02-60:27:04) He said that “We are warriors, and this time, we are on the top.” He loves flights and cannot bear to be the second. He had the beliefs that if he was not powerful or in the other words, violence enough, he would be treated unfairly. He would like to start wars in order to show his power, and dominate status, which reflect toxic masculinity.
    
    2. What he did:
    
    (60:25:26-60:25:27) When the servant said destroying the heart herbs is violating their traditions, Eric was frightened, and clutched the servant's neck. He is always anxious and prefer to flights. He did not treated everyone equally like T challa. When he became the king, he always show that how aggressive he was.
    
    3. Appearance:
    
    (60:00:49-60:00:53) We can see that there are so many marks on Eric's body. As he claim that “Each one of a kill.” He was so violent and was proud of what he made. From his point of views, the people who are weak should be killed, which reflect toxic masculinity.
</p>




<h2>THREE TIME STAMP ANNOTATIONS ABOUT THE SUPPORTING CHARACTERS</h2>
<p>
    1. What they said:

    (00:22:54-00:22:56) “Our technological advancements have been overseen by a child who scoffs at traditions.” M'Baku said on the challenge day. His dialogues give me a feeling that he does not think women can be so independent, and it is a shame to let the young girl take control of all technology, which shows toxic masculinity. He ignored the truth that Shuri proves with her scientific advancements that girls can be amazing in the scientific field.
    
    2. What they did:
    
    (60:50:04-60:50:05) When W'Kabi asked Okoye would she killed him. Okoye responded “For Wakanda, without questions.”As a staunch defender of the throne, she is unwilling to abandon her responsibilities at the whims of a man. To herself, there are so many things more important than love. I rarely see women in very graceful and determined movies. Even in love, they are assertive and capable of independent thinking. When they need to choose between your dreams and the man you love, just choose dreams.
    
    3. Appearance:
    
    (00:21:55-00:21:56) Shuri said “This corset makes us really uncomfortable.” Although she said this in order to let everyone relax, we can still see that women no matter who you are need to wear something uncomfortable when the big ceremonies come. As we all know, corsets are harmful to people's bodies. I do not think people should wear this for any kind of reason.
