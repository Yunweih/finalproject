      <h2>THREE TIME STAMP ANNOTATIONS ABOUT THE LEADING FEMALE</h2>
<p>
1. (00:06:37-00:06:39) When Aladdin asked why Princess Jasmine never came out from the palace, Jasmine responded: “The queen was killed, the sultan’s been afraid, so she was kept locked away.” At that period of time, fathers, husbands, or men dominated women. Women are inferior to men, and although they read numerous books, the influence is little and hard to change others’ opinions.

2. (60:43:44-60:43:45) After Jafar kept the old sultan, Princess Jasmine agreed to the marriage with Jafar. This gives me a feeling that Princess Jasmine treated herself as an object and can use herself in order to achieve some goals. The possibility for the young children who watch the movies to have impressions that they can use their own bodies to achieve some goals, which is inappropriate.

3. Jasmine rarely appears fully dressed throughout the movie, instead wearing her iconic crop tops and pants.This is the way most Arab women dress in movies and will give Westerners a completely false impression that  all women  in this part of the world are dressed this way. Jasmine is said to be 16 years old, however she is also portrayed to have a big breast and thin waist which may misled people or young children that every girl should be this.

<h2>THREE TIME STAMP ANNOTATIONS ABOUT THE LEADING MALE</h2>
<p>
1. (60:01:10-60:01:14) When Princess Jasmine asked “Am I for sale?” Aladdin answered: “Of course.” People can potentially perceive that Aladdin may get nervous at that time, however, what his response was really insulting women, which reflects that he subconsciously thought women are objects, no matter whether you are princess or not. They are not as powerful as men.

2. (60:29:38-60:29:40) After Aladdin took Jasmine look around the city, he wants Genie to help him keep lying and refuse to send Genie free. In the whole movie, male characters are described as ambitious, selfish, and forget their true wants. Even the main character did the same things. I think this may enhance the stereotypes that men are trustless.

3. (00:52:52-00:53:00) The Genie gave Aladdin white customers and made him Prince Ali. In these films we can see that positive men characters’ customers are very colorful and bright, colors like white, light red or green opposite to some dark colors. I do not think it is appropriate to associate meanings to colors, which may contribute that only certain genders or characters can wear certain colors.

<h2>THREE TIME STAMP ANNOTATIONS ABOUT THE VILLAIN</h2>
<p>
1. (00:22:47-00:23:01) Jafar said to Jasmine “Once you accept these traditions, and understand it is better for you to be seen not heard.” Jafar was a typical man who would like to dominate everyone. For him, women are adorable ornaments, they do not need to express their feelings, the only thing they need to do is to keep beauty. He shows toxic masculinity.

2. (60:43:20-60:43:25) Jafar asked Jasmine to marry him. According to the whole movie, we cannot not see that Jafar loved Jasmine, all he wanted was a beautiful, young wife. What he did illustrated he was trapped into toxic masculinity.

3. (00:11:25-00:12:38) When Jafar first comes into the scene, the surroundings are dark, there are not enough lights around him. Moreover, he dressed up in dark colors. I do not think it is appropriate to give all protagonists dark colors.
</p>




<h2>THREE TIME STAMP ANNOTATIONS ABOUT THE SUPPORTING CHARACTERS</h2>
<p>
1. (00:21:45-00:21:49) “We must find you a husband. You cannot be a sultan.”the old sultan said to Princess Jasmine. Although the old sultan loved his daughter, he refused to let her daughter be the new sultan, which reflects that the old sultan did not think women are independent enough to control a whole country, they are accessories of men.

2. (60:09:24-60:09:30) In the background, Genie is doing some workout. We can see that men characters also care about their body shapes.

3. (00:55:24-00:58:40) Other servants dressed as colorful customers when they performed dances to the public. The color of the customers include light yellow and pink which can catch people’s eyes easily. They look like a sort of nude corset, there are a lot of breast exposed in the air, their waist movement, and their eyesight all indicate some feelings of sex which are inappropriate for young girls. It is hard to imagine young girls who would like to dress up like characters in Aladdin need to bare most of their skins.
