            Gender Construction: How Disney using their characters to enhance or change the gender values?</h1>
        <p>In recent years, Disney has played an important role in not only adults' life, but also younger generations' life. It is important to realize how it contributes to gender constructions. Basically, in this Podcast, we will discuss whether Disney still has gender issues based on analyzing the films Frozen, Aladdin, the Beauty and the Beast, and the Sleeping Beauty.</p>
        <p>This Podcast mainly discusses some potential problems that Disney movies can convey to their audiences, and how they affect young children' development. They shared their personal experiences and personal feelings towards these films. Most of the time, they agree with each other. However, it is inevitable for them to have some disagreements. The guest said one of the influences Disney movies have is that "Having the idea that life can be so easy to achieve is a bad message to send to anybody." I totally agree with this sentence and think no matter which gender you are, believing in this kind of idea is really dangerous. For example, we can see in the Aladdin, he has three wishes and he wastes them on trying to impress Princess Jasmine. Later, he nearly lost his life to pay for the consequences by using the wishes.</p>
        <p>This Podcast contains music almost from the beginning to the end. The speaker and the host mainly interact with each other by asking questions, pulling up different ideas, and chatting. They also share their own experiences with each other as evidence to express their ideas. Music can create a relaxed and casual environment for our Podcast, which can make people more engaged in our Podcast and be willing to listen more. </p>
